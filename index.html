      <p class="lead">Our PSL Query Service <strong>removes the need to parse the PSL</strong> on the application level. Instead, it enables simple lookups to <strong>immediately retrieve public suffix information</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="lead">PSL information is required in various contexts, for example for cookie scoping in browsers, for certificate issuance, and for the secure operation of authoritative multi-tenant nameservers. The <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list">list itself</a> is maintained as a text file on GitHub.</p>
    <p class="lead">Until now, applications requiring information from the PSL were compelled to bring their own copy of the list, parse it, and extract the required information using a multi-staged <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/">algorithm</a>. In addition to the implementation and processing effort, applications also had to make sure to keep their local PSL copy up to date.</p>
    <p class="lead">Our PSL Query Service removes the need for applications to parse or refresh the PSL altogether. Instead, it facilitates <strong>simple lookups to immediately retrieve the public suffix</strong> that is associated with a given name.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p class="lead">We created the DNS zone <samp>query.publicsuffix.zone</samp>. The public suffix for a <code>$DOMAIN</code> can be retrieved by querying the <samp>PTR</samp> record at <samp><code>$DOMAIN</code>.query.publicsuffix.zone</samp>. The PSL rules are encoded in the zone's records by means of crafty <samp>CNAME</samp> redirects and shrewd wildcard configurations, such that the DNS lookup eventually arrives at a <samp>PTR</samp> record which does indeed point to the public suffix of <code>$DOMAIN</code>.</p>
    <p class="lead">If <code>$DOMAIN</code> is subject to multiple PSL rules (e.g. it is covered by a wildcard, but an exception is defined), you will find <samp>TXT</samp> records alongside the <samp>PTR</samp> record, representing the PSL rules that were applied but overruled.</p>
    <p class="lead">Please note that DNS resolvers learn about the domains that get queried, so depending on the use case, using this service may not be up to your privacy standards. In case you are interested in running a local copy of the PSL Query Service, please contact us via GitHub.</p>

    <h2>Libraries</h2>
    <p class="lead">Instead of querying the PSL zone yourself, you can use libraries to conveniently handle the lookup for you:</p>
    <ul class="lead">
      <li>Python: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/psl-dns/">psl-dns</a>, both library and command-line tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p class="lead">The PSL specification allows for inline wildcards. For example, <samp>public.*.tld</samp> would we a valid PSL rule, signifying that a third-level domain under <samp>tld</samp> whose third-level label is <samp>public</samp> is a public suffix, regardless of the second-level label. Unfortunately, such rules cannot be directly mapped onto the DNS, and any possible workarounds would require auxiliary DNS lookups. As a result, the desired information would not generally be determinable with just one query.</p>
    <p class="lead">Luckily, the PSL currently does not contain any such pathologic cases as of now, so that this limitation currently is of no consequence. Libraries such as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/psl-dns/">psl-dns</a> handle these cases gracefully, should they ever occur.</p>
    <p class="lead">Wildcards at the left-most position are supported (such as <samp>*.ck</samp>), including exception rules (such as <samp>www.ck</samp>).</p>

    <h2>Who runs this service?</h2>
    <p class="lead">The Public Suffix Query Service is provided for free. It is operated by <a href="https://securesystems.de/">SSE</a>, a Berlin-based IT security consultancy. SSE is invested in developing and promoting DNS-related (and other) security services for the public.</p>
    <p class="lead">The PSL zone <samp>query.publicsuffix.zone</samp> is hosted with <a href="https://desec.io/">deSEC</a>, a DNS hosting provider focusing on improving the security level of the DNS ecosystem.</p>
